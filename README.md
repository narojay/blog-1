For some reason, I decide to rebuild my bolg to record my journey of coding.

The initial plan is:

* This repository is used to track issues only(now).

* Source code will be private at first(GitHub or Azure OpsDev).

* Vue.js for front end.

* ASP.NET Core/Nest.js for service(not decided).

**Flag: This project will be maintained frequently.**
